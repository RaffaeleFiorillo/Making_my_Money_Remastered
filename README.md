# Description of the Game
In this section I will talk about how the game works, the agents and entities involved,... and all that stuff 

## Goal
You must collect the most amount of money possible, while staying alive by avoiding touching the enemies.


## Main Character
![io vivo](https://github.com/RaffaeleFiorillo/Making_my_Money/assets/75253335/cc209fcc-7da0-4572-9ced-1096b48230bc)

This is the Character you control. His name is "Io"(It)/ "Me"(Eng)/ "Eu"(Pt). He can move Up, Down, Left and Right and also in any (logically possible) diagonal combination of these directions. 
 After hitting an enemy, the Main Character becomes invulnerable for a short period of time, which is shown by having a translucent appearance.

## Enemies
![enemy](https://github.com/RaffaeleFiorillo/Making_my_Money/assets/75253335/fd402cfe-fd7f-4de3-a254-b963f729dfc2)

There is a total of 5 Enemies. All look and move in the same way. They can move horizontally and vertically, but only in one of them at the time. Their movement is random, hence unpredictable.

## Money
Collectables that pop out randomly and at random places during the game. You must touch them to gain Money. There are 3 different kind of collectables, each one with it's own value (Coin < Golden Ingot < Diamond).

### Coin
![moneta](https://github.com/RaffaeleFiorillo/Making_my_Money/assets/75253335/b6e11901-5ebe-45cf-9827-aa1da55bab2c)

The most common Money collectable, but also the least valuable. It holds a value of 5 points.

### Golden Ingot
![pepita](https://github.com/RaffaeleFiorillo/Making_my_Money/assets/75253335/21091f22-cb81-4c93-8164-ab867f8950ce)

This collectable is not as common as the coin, but it shows up once in a while. It holds a value of 50 points.

### Diamond
![diamante](https://github.com/RaffaeleFiorillo/Making_my_Money/assets/75253335/97365169-c34e-4bcb-83f2-847f0028a2cf)

This item is both mythical and legendary. Only a few chosen individuals manage to see it. It holds a value of 5000 points.

## Life Points
Another type of Collectable. The Main Character gains Life Points when he collects one. 
The amount of Life Points gained depends on the type of Life Point Collectable.

### HP Coin
